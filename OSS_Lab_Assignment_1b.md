# Advanced GitHub Usage - OSS Lab Assignment 1b

## 1. Advanced GitHub Topics
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): Automate workflows, CI/CD, and more.
- [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages): Host and manage packages securely.

## 2. Matrix Transpose in C
**Code:** See `matrix_transpose.c`
**Repository URL:** https://github.com/KansalJiCommits/CollegeAssignments

## 3. Word Frequency Counter in C
**Code:** See `word_frequency.c`
**Repository URL:** https://github.com/KansalJiCommits/CollegeAssignments

## 4. Open-Source C Graph Algorithm Project
- **Project:** [Dijkstra Algorithm in C](https://github.com/saadtaame/Dijkstra-Algorithm)
- **Analysis:**
  - `main.c`: Entry point, reads graph data, calls Dijkstra function.
  - `dijkstra.c`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm, manages distances and visited nodes.
  - `graph.c`: Handles graph creation and manipulation.
  - Each function is modular, with clear separation of concerns.
